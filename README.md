# Design-and-Development-of-Protection-System-for-the-Rescue-Team

Safety is a major problem today, especially for the rescue crew. The release of harmful chemicals, a shortage of oxygen, and natural calamities are the main threats to their health. In this project, we created a system for continuous environmental monitoring that keeps track of things like oxygen levels and harmful gases like methane, carbon dioxide, and carbon monoxide. We create intelligent clothing for the rescue crew here. A tool that can be utilized to ensure the safety of rescue personnel is the smart suit. The tool can be used to keep an eye on the safety requirements of those workers' working environments. This gadget measures vibration, humidity, hazardous gas concentration, and temperature. The control room receives the data, processes it, and chooses what to do with it based on the sent parameters. In this study, data is sent and received using LoRa communication technology, and processed using an Arduino. HX710B, MQ9, DHT11, and MAX30102 sensors can be used to obtain the parameters. The location is also monitored using the installed GPS module. The major goal of employing LoRa communication is to ensure that the connection is robust even at greater distances than Zigbee can cover. Zigbee has a range of up to 300 meters, however LoRa's range can reach up to 5 km, depending on the local traffic. The information from the sensors is processed by the Arduino microcontroller before being sent over GSM and LoRa. The control room can act appropriately, evacuating the employees if necessary, or improving the situation. Further the data is uploaded to the cloud where it can be monitored.
